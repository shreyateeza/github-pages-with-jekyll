Title: "State of Dilemma"
Author: shreyateeza

Hi everybody! This is my first blog post here in shreyateeza da blog.
I have written few posts before and a series on machine learning too.
This time and my first time I plan to write about something different
in a different manner, i.e., state of DILEMMA.

First let's understand what it means. I found two meanings. These are-
1. a situation in which a difficult choice has to be made between two
different things you could do.
2. a situation in which a difficult choice has to be made between two
or more alternatives, especially ones that are equally undesirable.

Which one would you like to accept as its meaning? The choice between 
the ones you could do or the ones you can't do? I will choose the former
one i.e. a situation in which a difficult choice has to be made between
two different things I could do.

Now think of a situation which on doing, will benefit you and others*.
Then there's other situation which on doing will benefit only you.
Which one would you prefer to do? The only selfish person will choose
the second option whereas a person who is lesser selfish and more 
generous than that of first, would choose the first option.

Now after writing all these means that the ones who choose second 
option are pessimistic in nature? Can be, but not necessarily! There
can be this state too as it is a state of dilemma. So what to do in 
this case?

I leave it up to you to think! Do write the your views in the comments 
section. Also, express if you liked this post or want some improvement.

Thankya!
