# Teach a Lesson

Hola readers! How you doin'? I hope things are in good spirits :)
This is the usual thing people say. We know the meaning of good 
spirit. Infact,we know the meaning of bad spirit too? Right? 
Now you might be wondering whether she(means me) is again going to
describe about the good and bad. 

The answer is Yes! This time with a positive and good approach 
haha :D Sounds boring! Trust me its worth it :P

Let's try to keep it as short and simple as possible. As you can 
observe the heading says 'Teach a Lesson'. I want to ask the 
following questions:

  1. Can 'Good' be related to 'Teaching lesson'?
  2. Can 'Bad' be related to 'Teaching someone a lesson'?

Everyone has their POV, so I leave it up to you to ponder and 
wonder. I don't want to spread my exact thoughts with you, I just 
want to share some in the form of unanswered questions so that 
everybody get a chance to perceive things in their way.

Do it and let me know with your comments how you felt and what 
you thought about.

After these, I have another set of questions to ask:

  1. Will 'Good' be related to 'Teaching lesson'?
  2. Will 'Bad' be related to 'Teaching someone a lesson'?

Actually, I am a lovely lass with lots of lesson 
to make you learn in a way being liked ;P
